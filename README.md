## Treap Contest Participants Manager

This project is a **C++ program** that manages contest participants using a **Treap** data structure. It allows for insertion, deletion, searching, and statistical queries based on player data.

##  Features

✅ Load participants from a file  
✅ Delete participant by `ID` or `signup date`  
✅ Find the k-th best player based on `rank`  
✅ Print participants registered between two timestamps  
✅ Find best player before a certain date  
✅ Efficient operations using a self-balancing Treap

##  What is a Treap?

A **Treap** is a combination of:

- A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** based on `signupTime`
- A **Min-Heap** based on a random `priority` value

This combination guarantees **logarithmic time complexity** for most operations, maintaining a balanced structure with randomized priorities.

---

##  Requirements

- C++ compiler (`g++`, `clang++`, etc.)
- Input file: `contest_participants.txt`

---

##  Installation & Execution

## Compile

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o contest treap_program.cpp
```
##  Input File Format
The program reads data from a file named contest_participants.txt, where each line represents a participant in the format:
```text
<Name>,<ID>,<Rank>,<Country>,<SignupTime>
```
ID: unique integer identifier

Rank: smaller is better (1 = best)

SignupTime: integer representing the registration timestamp
##  Example Input
**contest_participants.txt**
```bash
Alice,1,5,USA,1001
Bob,2,3,Greece,1002
Carol,3,1,Germany,1003
Dave,4,2,France,1004
Eve,5,4,Italy,1005
```

## Technical Details
- Node class holds each participant's data:
- Name, ID, Rank, Country, Signup Time, Priority
- Treap operations:
- insert(Node*): inserts participant while preserving BST and heap properties
- split(), merge(): used for fast deletion or range operations
- deleteByID(int id): deletes a participant with a specific ID
- deleteBySignupDate(int date): deletes all participants with exact signupTime
- findKthBestRank(k): uses a max-heap to retrieve the k-th best ranked player
- printIDsInRange(t1, t2): in-order traversal to collect IDs
- findBestRankBeforeDate(date): traverses nodes to find minimum rank before a date
